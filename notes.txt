if print ls return, could read that from the input. fork the child and exec what the parent __DBL_DIG__
wait until the child completes.
just read ls or date or whatever command or no command and fork child and having the child running
and read the parents
read the same data the child went in
wait pid-1, don't care what the child is

// create a simple ls command working.
// one pipe two children to pipe with ls count working
// Even though can't fork one process and wait for it to complete
// Duping with the children.
// waiting for that to complete and read side of the pipe
// wc command in the sam example
// Close the write side of the pipe
// Run it in parallel, going to block and run it in the back
// While still child outstanding.
// Wait pid while child is waiting
// close the pipe so the parent is doing the pipe command
// Make sure to not blindly malloc a command to make sure it works
// Redirect need to use dupe

if (getJump(thread1_jumpbuffer) == 0){
    // got here after sacking state (thread1)
    // choose the next threat to run (thread 2)
    LongJump(Thread2.Jumpbufffer, NON-ZERO);
} else {
    // continue running thread 2
    return;
